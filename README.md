# auto_route_deep_linking

Minimal reproducible example of my deep linking issue with `auto_route` Flutter library.

I basically put all the code into the `main.dart` file, then added a few dependencies in the `pubspec.yaml` file, and added deep linking in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file, and the `Infos.plist` file.

Hope this will help ðŸ™‚
